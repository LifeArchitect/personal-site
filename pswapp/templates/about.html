  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a 3rd year undergraduate pursuing a direct masters in Computer Science & Business from UC Berkeley and
    Nanyang Technological University (NTU), under the Renaissance Engineering Programme. My passion lies in using
    cutting-edge technology to empower organizations and people in the areas of predictive modeling and human potential.
    <br>
    <br>
    As a Full Stack Machine Learning Developer, I have built chatbots, blockchain web apps and predictive modeling
    algorithms during my work with Ramco Systems, DataRobot and my Personal Projects. My core stack includes Django,
    Node.js and Neural Networks (ANNs, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, Transfer & One-Shot Learning).
    <br>
    <br>
    As an entrepreneur, I have experience in product sales, digital marketing and management consulting during my
    work with Street Smart University, Awaken Group, ICON and founded my own start up, Pursue Your Passion, to
    provide career coaching for youths.

    The purpose of this site is two-fold: 1) To showcase a growing portfolio of my work and 2) To experiment and
    play around with cool projects, e.g.implmenting interactive neural nets in the browser. I hope you'll find the
    content I put out to be of value. Have a look at my resume for more information.
